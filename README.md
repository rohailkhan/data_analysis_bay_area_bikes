# data_analysis_bay_area_bikes
Bay Area Bike Share is a company that provides on-demand bike rentals for customers in San Francisco, Redwood City, Palo Alto, Mountain View, and San Jose. Users can unlock bikes from a variety of stations throughout each city, and return them to any station within the same city. Users pay for the service either through a yearly subscription or by purchasing 3-day or 24-hour passes. Users can make an unlimited number of trips, with trips under thirty minutes in length having no additional charge; longer trips will incur overtime fees. In this project, you will put yourself in the shoes of a data analyst performing an exploratory analysis on the data. You will take a look at two of the major parts of the data analysis process: data wrangling and exploratory data analysis. But before you even start looking at data, think about some questions you might want to understand about the bike share data. Consider, for example, if you were working for Bay Area Bike Share: what kinds of information would you want to know about in order to make smarter business decisions? Or you might think about if you were a user of the bike share service. What factors might influence how you would want to use the service?

Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb - Main project file.

babs_datacheck.py; babs_visualizations.py - Supplemental scripts for checking data wrangling, reporting of basic statistics, and creation of exploratory bar charts and histograms.

*_README.txt - Information about contents of data files.

*_station_data.csv - Basic information about station locations and capacities.
